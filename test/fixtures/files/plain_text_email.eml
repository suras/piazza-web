We never should have landed a man on the moon. It's a mistake. Now everything is compared to that one accomplishment. I can't believe they could land a man on the moon ... and taste my coffee! I think we all would have been a lot happier if they hadn't landed a man on the moon. Then we'd go, 'They can't make a prescription bottle top that's easy to open?'
